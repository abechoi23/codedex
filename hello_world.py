""" 02. Hello World
# Print
In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to "talk." This is something we are going to use a lot.


The message we want to display should be inside the parentheses and surrounded by quotes. They can be double quotes " or single quotes ', but the opening and closing quote marks have to be the same.

This is an example of a print() function:

print('ðŸ‘‹ Howdy')

In the example above, we instructed our program to print a message. This resulting text that is printed to the screen is referred to as the output.

The output of this example program would be:

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy

# Instructions
Create a new file called hello_world.py using your editor of choice.

On line 1, use print() to output the message "Hello World!"

Save the file and then run it.

Were you able to print "Hello World!" in the terminal?
 """
print('Hello World!')
