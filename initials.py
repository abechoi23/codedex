""" 04. Initials
# Comments
Comments are very important in programming because they are used to document what our code does. They are also used to disable parts of the program.

When the program is run, the comments are ignored.

In Python, we can create a comment using the # hashtag symbol:

# Printing out a message 
print('Hi')

On the first line, we created a comment. As a result, everything to the right of the hashtag # is ignored. The program continues to the next line, and the output is simply:

Hi

Python only ignores anything after the # on a line. So when a comment is placed towards the end of a line:

print('Hi')   # I'm a comment, too!

Here, the output would still be "Hi" because everything before the comment on the same line will still run.

# Instructions
Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.

First, start your program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.

Then, create your block letters with your initials.

For example, if your name is Ada Lovelace, your initials would be A and L, and your block letters would look like this:

  A    L
 A A   L
A   A  L
AAAAA  L
A   A  L
A   A  L
A   A  LLLLL """


print('  A      CCCCCCC')
print(' A  A    C')
print('A    A   C')
print('AAAAAA   C')
print('A    A   C')
print('A    A   C')
print('A    A   CCCCCCC')
